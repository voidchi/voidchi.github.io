About Me page for GA interview (notes)
by: Pat Ray

I wanted to make some notes on the process here for our conversation,
rather than leaving vestigial code commented out in the final version.

1. Design
I first sketched out a concept that would fulfill all of the requirements of the exercise, consisting of a simple two column layout. On the left, my picture. On the right, my contact info and biography.

2. Implementation
Making the columns work the way that I had envisioned was a bit tougher than I imagined. I began by doing a simple "float" on the image, but could not get the text and buttons on the other side to work exactly how I wanted. I ended up using "row" and "column" classes to split the page. I look forward to learning flexbox, but it seemed like overkill in this case.

3. Javascript
I faced challenges on this project both designing and implementing Javascript. Design-wise, I had a hard time figuring out what problem I could solve with the inclusion of Javascript. I settled on adding a simple clock, and changing the section with my contact info and bio from a list to buttons with associated functions.
